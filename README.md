## Introduction

I come from Baltimore and ever since I was in my teens, I have always dreamt of becoming someone who works with computers.
Now, that's a vast list of possibilities that I did not know I had to choose from. It's been quite a journey trying to find the right
thing I wanted to do. Finally, one day I chose the path of becoming a Pentester. I need to learn to code so I can create new tools and the obvious,
to read it as well. I am excited to see how much I will start to learn on this journey! Stay posted !

## Here's a couple of goals I wish to accomplish...
- Creating a working line of code
- Reaching 200 lines of code effectively
- Learning basic concepts of code

# SEE YOU OUT THERE!
